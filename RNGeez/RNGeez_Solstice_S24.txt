// Something New
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I recently broke out my Something New from last season with Headstone / Wellspring which is a shame we cannot get that roll this year. The closest is a heavier investment into grenades with Demolitionist. While not the worst weapon, losing Wellspring puts this behind Eyasluna for me, yes even without the origin trait."

// Something New
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB): "Potentially a higher stat version of Crimil’s Dagger, the Something New with Elemental Capacitor and Precision Instrument looks to take over your kinetic slot. I was waiting for this weapon to come up instead of trying within Iron Banner. Enhanced Void Elemental Capacitor giving you a whopping +25 in stability or +55 handling on Arc brings up the stats so much that you might forget about Igneous Hammer."

// Something New
//notes:SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "For me, this combination is tried and true. Headstone will spawn stasis crystals that can serve as extensions of the gun.. Meaning those stasis crystal explosions will fuel demo. Handy dandy indeed, and allows for much spam. However, it's missing some reload, and like most 120rpm HCs, this big boi NEEDS it. With the Dream Work origin trait, you can certainly get by, but I still like to hedge my bets and get as much reload as I can from mag and MW. Plus, I'm sort of curious about Nadir Focus, so I wont always have Dream Work locked and loaded." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Something New
//notes:SirStallion_ (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Now, I've given this thing a lot of stability. And it's going to get even more from Rapid Hit. To me, for PvP, my ability to hit shots with such a slow firing weapon is far more important than hitting for full damage a few metres further. Rapid Hit should hypothetically fix my reload problems as well as giving me more stability to help combat flinch. Kill Clip is just.. Nice. With how easy a lot of us can get Radiant going when we need to, the combo of damage perks should give me some slay potential. Otherwise, I'd definitely be looking at Explosive Payload just to annoy people." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Compass Rose
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I've always liked the wombo combo of Grave Robber / Melee perk. One-Two Punch is usually my go-to but in precision and aggressives where the base damage is higher I flip flop between One-Two Punch and Trench Barrel. It switches up the order of operations which is sometimes too much for me. But it's always a nice synergy weapon to keep in your vault." Recommended MW - Handling.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Compass Rose
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "The only weapon I'm looking for grinding this Solstice is the Compass Rose with Slickdraw. I have been an avid fan of Slickdraw for quite some time. It rolled on a few pellet shotguns so far but has fallen short mostly due to bad stats or accompanying perks. Deadpan Delivery was the first and really couldn't compete without a 5/5. Next were some lightweight frames that didn't need Slickdraw to hit high handling, so it was wasted. Now it's on a precision frame that can also hit max handling and get Assault Mag to boost follow up shots is going to replace my energy shotguns entirely."

// Compass Rose
//notes:SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I wouldn't normally bust out a precision frame shotgun in PvE for its shooting ability, but I might honestly make an exception here. Slide, bang, boom, slide. Reload rounds, explode enemies, reload rounds again.. It fulfills my hunters fantasy of spending 100% of her in the mud. I'm gonna turn mobbing jobs into the worlds explodiest slip n slide, you just watch." Recommended MW - Handling.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Compass Rose
//notes:SirStallion_ (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "I.. Cannot believe I want this. I hate slickdraw, it makes me so annoyed when I see it on guns.. Usually. But this is a shotgun. You're going for centre mass and the target acquisition just doesn't matter. Holy heck. You can have maximum handling and full send into range in tandem. So that's what I'm going to do, Opening Shot will do so much work, I'll have the snappiest little boomstick you've ever seen and have almost max range. Also this gun has regular old barrels? So that's weird. But it means if you don't want slickdraw, you have much nicer handling options." Recommended MW - Range.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller
